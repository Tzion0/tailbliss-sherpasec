Our fifth meetup for this community was indeed an engaging event where local cybersecurity enthusiasts gathered to share knowledge and contribute to the collective expertise of the community. We were excited to have announced our distinguished speakers for the meetup: the first speaker was a seasoned reverse engineer deeply passionate about reverse engineering and low-level development. The second speaker was a talented student eager to share insights and perspectives. After a productive networking session, each speaker had a dedicated 45-minute slot to present on a topic of their choice. It provided a fantastic opportunity for attendees, whether they were students or seasoned professionals, to learn, interact, and expand their professional network.

Thank you to all who attended and contributed to making this event a success!
