Our first activity for this community was the organization of a meetup where local cybersecurity talents could share and contribute their knowledge to the community. We were thrilled to have had two speakers lined up, one a university student, and the other a cybersecurity professional with years of industry experience. Each speaker had 30 minutes to present on a topic of their choice, followed by a networking session. Whether attendees were students or professionals, it was an excellent opportunity to learn, connect, and grow their networks.

Thank you to everyone who participated!
