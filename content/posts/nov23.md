Our fourth meetup for this community concluded successfully, where local cybersecurity peers had the chance to share their knowledge and contribute to the collective expertise of the community. We were thrilled to announce that we had two distinguished speakers confirmed for the meetup: one was a fresh graduate who was interested in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, and the other was a seasoned industry veteran with 13 years of experience in the IT Security, Compliance, and Attestation engagements field. After a networking session, each speaker had a dedicated 40-minute slot to present on a topic of their choice. This presented an incredible opportunity for students and professionals alike to learn, interact, and expand their professional network.

Thank you to everyone who participated in making this event a success!
